SETUP
=====
- Copy config/config.example to config/config.yml
- Edit the file and insert your login details for Basecamp and Lighthouse
- Create config/milestones.yml
- Add the milestones from Basecamp and Lighthouse (This process should really be automated...) 
  You can put an ignore: true on any milestone that you want lantern to ignore from checking. 

USING LANTERN
=============
- Run 'ruby lantern.rb' and it will sync Basecamp Milestones -> Lighthouse Milestones. 
- if you change a Milestone completed date in Basecamp just rerun the script and it will update Lighthouse

TODO
====
- Automate the discovery of Milestones and the creating of milestones.yml
- Allow syncing of Basecamp -> Lighthouse or Lighthouse -> Basecamp
